# lein-with-env-vars

A Leiningen plugin for performing a task with environment variable settings loaded from project.clj

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-with-env-vars "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-with-env-vars "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein with-env-vars
